### Andrew Ng Machine Learning Notes
This part is the notes that I made from the [Machine Learning](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV164411b7dx?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_custom_collection.content.click) video made by Andrew Ng.

I use the Mind Map to show every chapter and each image represents a chapter.
